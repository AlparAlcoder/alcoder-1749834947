# FastAPI Event Management API

The provided code is an API built using FastAPI for managing events. It exposes several HTTP endpoints for performing CRUD operations on events. Each event has an `id`, `name`, `location`, and `date`.

## Dependencies

To run this code, you will need the following Python libraries:

- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- Uvicorn (for serving the application)

You can install these with pip:

```
pip install fastapi pydantic uvicorn
```

## Data Model

The `Event` model represents an event with the following attributes:

- `id`: An integer that uniquely identifies the event.
- `name`: A string that represents the event's name.
- `location`: A string that represents the location of the event.
- `date`: A string that represents the date of the event.

## Endpoints

### `GET /events/`

Returns a list of all events.

**Response model:** List of `Event`

### `GET /events/{event_id}`

Returns a single event by its `id`.

**Parameters:**

- `event_id` (path, integer)

**Response model:** `Event`

### `POST /events/`

Creates a new event.

**Request body:** `Event`

**Response model:** `Event`

### `PUT /events/{event_id}`

Updates an existing event.

**Parameters:**

- `event_id` (path, integer)

**Request body:** `Event`

**Response model:** `Event`

### `DELETE /events/{event_id}`

Deletes an event.

**Parameters:**

- `event_id` (path, integer)

**Response:** JSON object with a message indicating successful deletion.

## Example Usage

To create an event, you would send a POST request to `/events/` with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "My Event",
  "location": "My Location",
  "date": "2022-01-01"
}
```

To get a list of all events, you would send a GET request to `/events/`.

To get a single event, you would send a GET request to `/events/{event_id}`, replacing `{event_id}` with the ID of the event you want to retrieve.

## Important Notes

- If an operation fails (for example, if you try to retrieve an event that does not exist), the API will return an HTTP 404 status code and a JSON response with the detail "Event not found".
- The data is stored in memory in the `events` list and will be lost when the application is stopped.
- This API does not handle any kind of authentication or authorization.
